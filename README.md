# Github Docs Example

## Step 1 - Using Codeblocks.

Codeblocks in markdown make it *very easy* for tech people to **copy, paste, and share** code.[<sup>[1]</sup>](#external-references)
A good __Cloud Engineer__ uses Codeblocks whenever possible.

Because it allows others to copy and paste their code to replicate or research issues.
- In order to create Codeblocks in markdown you need to use three backticks(`)
-  Not to be confused with quotation(')

```
# Define a Person class
class Person
  # Constructor
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name # Instance variable for the person's name
    @age = age  # Instance variable for the person's age
 ```

Make a note of where the backtick button is located.
It should appear above the tab key but may vary based on the keyboard layout.

Good Cloud Engineers use Codeblocks for both code and errors that appear in the console.

```bash
Traceback(most recent call last):
```
> Here is an example of using a Codeblock for an error that appears in bash.

## Step 3 Use Github Flavoured Markdown Task List
Github extends Markdown to have a list where you can check off items.<sup>[2]</sup>

- [x] Finish Step 1
- [x] Finish Step 2

## Step 4 - Use Emojis (Optional)

Github Flavoured Markdown (GFM) supports emoji shortcodes. 
Here are some examples:

|Name|Shortcode|Emoji|
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud |  `:cloud:` | :cloud: |
| Cloud with lighting |  `cloud_with_lighting` | üå©Ô∏è |

## Step 5 - Create A Table

```md
|Name|Shortcode|Emoji|
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud |  `:cloud:` | :cloud: |
| Cloud with lighting |  `cloud_with_lighting` | üå©Ô∏è |
```
